Description: This is a collection of .NET programs related to network monitoring and analysis developed by user f3hunter (Rick Sides) on SourceForge. Files are identical to what can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/network-ip-tools.

While there was no licence document on the programs themselves, the SourceForge repository says it is licenced under MIT.

All programs are self-contained executables, and require no installation. They were made with .NET, and consume very little RAM (usually on the single digits). Currently, only the IP Address tool has source code, that was weirdly provided as a .txt file. I'll ask him for all source codes on the SourceForge repository. A bit of a mess, I know, but the tools are quite useful. The programs are all GUI's.

They work under Windows 10 and possibly on 7 to 11, but I can't be certain. The dev provided no build instructions, nor any further information.

There is a total of 6 tools, one of them having 2 functions, for a total of 7 functions. They are:

1 - IP Adress: A simple program that displays your internal and external IP addresses.
2 - Remote Port Scanner: This tool can scan ports within an user-defined range for a given IP address.
3 - Speed Scan I & II: Both tools can do the same thing, although, weirdly, Speed Scan I seems to have more functions than II - I suppose the dev messed up the ordering, and the first should be the second, and vice-versa. They can scan a given IP range for connections, and, in both programs, there is a TCP/UDP sessions scanner too.
4 - Port Scanner will scan a specified port range for a given IP address. It will simply tell you whether such ports are open or closed.
5 - Network Kill Switch: Disables a given network adapter.
